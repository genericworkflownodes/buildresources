# buildresources

Note: This repository is deprecated. We completely moved to maven tycho for building. There might be some remnants of buckminster here and there
but we do not maintain building with it anymore. Also, the update site is now automatically generated with the GKN node generation recursive option,
to collect every feature and plugin in a folder. So de.openms.update will be generated on-the-fly and is not needed from here anymore.
